📘 Overview
An end-to-end machine learning classification project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using demographic and travel data.
This project demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques for real-world datasets.

🎯 Objectives
Predict the survival of passengers based on features such as age, gender, and class.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and handle missing values.
Apply models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
Evaluate model accuracy and interpret key survival factors.

⚙️ Features
✅ End-to-end ML workflow (EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation).
✅ Feature engineering for categorical and numerical variables.
✅ Comparison of multiple ML algorithms.
✅ Clear output visualization and insights in Jupyter Notebook.

🧩 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Key Insights

Female passengers and higher-class travelers had significantly higher survival rates.
Age and fare showed strong correlation with survival probability.
Random Forest achieved the highest overall accuracy and stability.
